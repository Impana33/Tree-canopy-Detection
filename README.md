# Tree-canopy-Detection
Identification of individual trees within the raster imagery, along with delineation of tree crowns, achieved with an accuracy of 80%
This project delivers an end-to-end, reproducible pipeline to detect and inventory trees from drone imagery. Using RGB orthomosaics (3-band) plus DSM/DTM, we build a Canopy Height Model (CHM), run DeepForest for canopy detections, and fuse multi-scale CHM local-maxima with watershed segmentation to grow crown polygons. The workflow outputs georeferenced tree points, crown polygons, per-tree height (max CHM), crown area, and CSV/GeoPackage layers (EPSG:32644) ready for QGIS/ArcGIS. Tuning knobs (score threshold, CHM min height, smoothing, crown scale) are exposed to boost recall in dense stands while controlling false positives. The pipeline scales via tiling and runs locally or in Google Colab; a future phase integrates aerial/ground LiDAR and 360Â° RGB for species ID and DBH/girth estimation
